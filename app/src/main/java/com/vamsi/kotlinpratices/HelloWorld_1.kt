/*
kotlin : kotlin statically type lang
        -> JVM lang : it needs java virtual machine (JVM) to execute its bytes code
        -> support to avoid null pointer exception
        -> supports immutability
        -> object oriented lang
        ->Functional prog lang
                    -> you can pass a function as parameter to function
                    -> or, function can return another function
                    -> lambhas, high level functions.. etx
        Less Ceremony :
             -> no more boiler plates
             -> less code, more results
             -> code looks clean

/* -> Kotlin saved as .kt and also kotlin creates a class internally.
   -> kotlin compiler internally creates a class file which is loaded into memory for execution in runtime.

    Kotlin--->        .kt --> bytecode ----(JVM) Helps----> executed
    Java  --->  .class ----> byteCode  ----(JVM) Helps----> executed
